                <h2>Currency Considerations</h2>
                <p>Deciding which currency to use for international invoices is an important consideration:</p>
                
                <h3>Options for Currency Selection</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Invoice in your local currency:</strong> Simplest for you but may be less convenient for your customer</li>
                    <li><strong>Invoice in the customer's currency:</strong> More convenient for your customer but exposes you to exchange rate risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Invoice in a major global currency:</strong> Using USD, EUR, or GBP can be a compromise solution</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Currency Conversion Best Practices</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clearly state the exchange rate used if converting currencies</li>
                    <li>Consider including a clause about exchange rate fluctuations</li>
                    <li>Use reputable sources for exchange rates (e.g., central banks, major financial institutions)</li>
                    <li>Consider using forward contracts or other hedging tools for large transactions</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="resource-section">
